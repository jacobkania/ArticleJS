<p>ArticleJS allows you to implement full-blown HTML into your pages. Use any tags that you're comfortable with. Since it's just injecting HTML into your page from a file, all of your websites styles will be applied to the article automatically.</p>
<p>I am working to make a minimalist front-end platform to load full-HTML news articles into a webpage, paired with tools to write and manage articles.</p>
<p>This is still an early work-in-progress, and all pull requests will be considered! Feel free to talk to me about any features that you're looking at adding. I've been developing software for several years, but this is my first big project with javascript. You can find my github profile <a href="https://github.com/jacobkania">here</a> if you'd like to chat!</p>
<p>Oh, also, this is licensed under a simple MIT license. You may do anything you like with the software, so long as you include the original license as it is written within the project's repository (which can be found <a href="https://github.com/jacobkania/ArticleJS">here</a>).</p><!/CONTENT>
